    <h1>My first prject for console</h1>
    <p>Hi I going to tell you about "Visual Studios"(This is my 2nd time using Visual Studios so I can't give a perfect review so I am giveing what I know till now) 
        1.It is somewhat like brackets but much more advanced 
        2. It has different colour themes and you can even download some! There are some really good ones also
        3. You can download many extintions <-- (If you do text-based coding with an IDE then you should know the meaning of this word and "IDE also") 4. It provides you with tonnes of help like it gives you some text-based codes <-- (This is what I like to call it) when you type words it saves them.
    </p>
    <p>Console is a page where you can test before doing it on the main HTML page. It is suggested to do so.</p>

        var y = 200;
        var a = x + y;
        var s = x - y;
        var m = x * y
        var d = x / y
        console.log("Hello! this is my first console project")
